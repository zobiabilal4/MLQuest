# Section 1
# Heart Disease Prediction Application

This section of the "ML Quest" repository contains a Streamlit application developed for predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a machine learning model. The application demonstrates the practical application of machine learning pipelines in real-world health data.

# Overview
The application allows users to input various health-related factors and receive a prediction on whether they might be at risk of heart disease. This project showcases the use of a logistic regression model combined with a robust preprocessing pipeline.

# Features
Interactive Web Interface: The app is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
Machine Learning Pipeline: The model utilizes a pipeline for data preprocessing and prediction, ensuring that the input data is appropriately handled.
Detailed Age Categories: The application includes detailed age categories, helping users understand the significance of each category in the prediction model.

# How to Run the Application
To run the heart disease prediction application:

- Navigate to the heart_disease_prediction folder in this repository.
- Ensure that all dependencies listed in requirements.txt are installed.
- Run the application using Streamlit:
- code
streamlit run app.py

Enter the required health information and click "Predict" to view the prediction.
# Project Structure
- app.py: The main Streamlit application file.
- model_pipeline.pkl: The saved machine learning model and preprocessing pipeline.
- requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required to run the application.
  you can easily install all the requirement by only running the code : pip install -r requirements.txt
